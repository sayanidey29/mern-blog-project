              into a business that thrives? Youâ€™re in the right place. Blogging
              has always required a diverse set of skills.

            <p>
              But in todayâ€™s competitive landscape we have to adapt to the
              reality that blogging is about more than just writing & publishing
              blog posts.

              One minute youâ€™re a social media manager, the next youâ€™re building
              an ecommerce store so your readers can buy merch. Then, youâ€™re
              building a sales funnel that allows you to sell products while you
              sleep. Then thereâ€™s filming and editing videos, etc. Thatâ€™s a lot.
